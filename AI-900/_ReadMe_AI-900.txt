	Challenge or Risk 	Example
	Bias can affect results 	A loan-approval model discriminates by gender due to bias in the data with which it was trained
	Errors may cause harm 	An autonomous vehicle experiences a system failure and causes a collision
	Data could be exposed 	A medical diagnostic bot is trained using sensitive patient data, which is stored insecurely
	Solutions may not work for everyone A home automation assistant provides no audio output for visually impaired users
	Users must trust a complex system 	An AI-based financial tool makes investment recommendations - what are they based on?
	Who's liable for AI-driven decisions? 	An innocent person is convicted of a crime based on evidence from facial recognition â€“ who's responsible?

What is machine learning?

Types of machine learning
	There are two general approaches to machine learning, supervised and unsupervised
		Regression: used to predict a continuous value; like a price, a sales total, or some other measure.
		Classification: used to determine a binary class label; like whether a patient has diabetes or not.
	Unsupervised machine learning without known label values
		Clustering: used to determine labels by grouping similar information into label groups; like grouping measurements from birds into species.
